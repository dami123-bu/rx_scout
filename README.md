### Repurposing × Systematic Candidate Output Using Transformers

*What if the next breakthrough treatment already exists — just for a different disease?*

## The Problem

Bringing a new drug to market takes 10–15 years and costs over $2 billion. Most candidates fail. But there's a shortcut hiding in plain sight: thousands of already-approved drugs that might work for diseases they were never designed to treat.

This is drug repurposing — and it's already responsible for some of medicine's biggest wins. Viagra was a failed heart medication before it became the world's most famous lifestyle drug. Thalidomide, once infamous for birth defects, is now a frontline cancer therapy. Metformin, a diabetes staple, is being studied for everything from Alzheimer's to aging itself.

The problem isn't that repurposing opportunities don't exist. It's that finding them requires a researcher to manually connect dots across thousands of papers, drug databases, and clinical trial registries. It takes weeks of digging through fragmented sources to build a single hypothesis.

RxSCOUT does that in minutes.
